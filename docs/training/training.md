# Training reference

This is the full reference for `phoonnx_train.train` — every flag, the training engines, and
the recipes for the multi-stage architectures. It is for anyone past the
[training quickstart](quickstart.md) who needs the complete picture. Preprocessing is covered
in the [preprocess reference](preprocess.md); ONNX conversion in [Export](export.md).

The pipeline is engine-agnostic: `--engine` selects an architecture, and the CLI delegates
model creation, checkpoint loading, and export to that engine.

```bash
python -m phoonnx_train.train --dataset-dir DIR [options]
```

## train.py options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--dataset-dir DIR` | required | Pre-processed dataset directory (contains `config.json`, `dataset.jsonl`) |
| `--engine NAME` | `vits` | Architecture to train (see [Engines](#engines)) |
| `--quality TEXT` | `medium` | Quality/size preset; validated against the engine's `quality_presets()` (falls back to `medium` or the first preset if unknown) |
| `--batch-size INT` | `16` | Training batch size |
| `--max-epochs INT` | `1000` | Stop after this many epochs |
| `--checkpoint-epochs INT` | `1` | Save a checkpoint every N epochs (all are kept) |
| `--validation-split FLOAT` | `0.1` | Fraction of data held out for validation |
| `--num-workers INT` | `4` | Data-loader worker processes |
| `--accelerator TEXT` | `auto` | `cpu`, `gpu`, `tpu`, `mps`, … |
| `--devices TEXT` | `1` | Number of devices or a list of device IDs (a string) |
| `--precision TEXT` | `32` | Precision: `16`, `32`, `bf16`, `16-mixed`, … (a string) |
| `--default-root-dir DIR` | none | Root for logs and checkpoints |
| `--seed INT` | `1234` | Random seed |
| `--resume-from-checkpoint PATH` | none | Load a checkpoint and resume |
| `--resume-from-single-speaker-checkpoint PATH` | none | Convert a single-speaker checkpoint to multi-speaker and resume |
| `--discard-encoder` | off | Discard encoder weights from the base checkpoint (not supported by all engines) |
| `--log-audio-samples / --no-log-audio-samples` | off | Log synthesized validation audio each epoch (needs a TensorBoard logger) |
| `--compile` | off | Compile the model with `torch.compile` for faster training |
| `--compile-mode {default,reduce-overhead,max-autotune,max-autotune-no-cudagraphs}` | `default` | `torch.compile` mode; only relevant with `--compile` |

> There is **no `--learning-rate` flag.** The optimizer and schedule are owned by the engine
> and its quality preset.

**Outputs.** Checkpoints are written by PyTorch Lightning under
`<default-root-dir>/lightning_logs/version_<N>/checkpoints/` as
`epoch=<E>-step=<S>.ckpt`. TensorBoard logs live under the same `lightning_logs` tree:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir <default-root-dir>/lightning_logs
```

## Engines

`--engine` accepts any registered training engine:

| `--engine` | Architecture | Notes / guide |
|---|---|---|
| `vits` | VITS end-to-end | Default; single-graph waveform |
| `glowtts` | GlowTTS (flow-based mel) | Two-stage; [guide](engines/glowtts.md) |
| `matcha` | Matcha (flow-matching mel) | Two-stage; [guide](engines/matcha.md) |
| `fastpitch` | ForwardTTS / FastPitch | Two-stage; [guide](engines/fastpitch.md) |
| `speedyspeech` | ForwardTTS / SpeedySpeech | Same engine as `fastpitch`, no pitch |
| `mixer` / `mixertts` | Mixer-TTS | Two-stage; [guide](engines/mixertts.md) |
| `zipvoice` | ZipVoice (flow-matching, in-context cloning) | [guide](engines/zipvoice.md) |
| `optispeech` | OptiSpeech (lightweight end-to-end, S4D attention) | Install `phoonnx[train,train-optispeech]` |
| `yourtts` | YourTTS (VITS + d-vector cloning) | See [Cloning](../cloning.md) |
| `styletts2` | StyleTTS2 / Kokoro | See [StyleTTS2](#styletts2-engine---engine-styletts2) below |
| `styletts2-aligner` | StyleTTS2 text aligner (ASRCNN) | Auxiliary model |
| `styletts2-plbert` | StyleTTS2 prosodic text encoder (PL-BERT) | Auxiliary model |
| `styletts2-pitch` | StyleTTS2 JDC pitch extractor | Auxiliary model |

`--quality` selects a preset defined by each engine (commonly `x-low` / `medium` / `high`;
some engines define their own, e.g. ZipVoice `base` / `low`).

## Resuming and fine-tuning

Resume an interrupted run (restores optimizer, scheduler and epoch):

```bash
python -m phoonnx_train.train --dataset-dir train_out \
  --resume-from-checkpoint train_out/runs/lightning_logs/version_0/checkpoints/epoch=50-step=12750.ckpt
```

**Fine-tune onto a new speaker/dataset:** preprocess the new data with `--prev-config` pointing
at the base voice's `config.json` so the phoneme-to-ID map is preserved (see the
[fine-tuning options](preprocess.md#fine-tuning-phoneme-map)), then train with
`--resume-from-checkpoint` on the base checkpoint.

**Single-speaker → multi-speaker:** `--resume-from-single-speaker-checkpoint` adapts a
single-speaker checkpoint into a multi-speaker model and resumes.

## engine_params and precedence

Engine-specific knobs (`asr_path`, `plbert_dir`, `stage`, `backbone`, `download_aux`,
`vocoder_path`, …) ride in an `"engine_params"` dict in the dataset's `config.json`. When an
engine reads a parameter, the effective value is resolved with this precedence:

**explicit CLI flag > `config.json` `engine_params` > CLI default > quality preset.**

## ZipVoice engine (`--engine zipvoice`)

Trains the ZipVoice flow-matching TTS (Zipformer text encoder + flow-matching decoder),
vendored in `phoonnx_train/zipvoice/`. It consumes the same preprocessed dataset as every other
engine; audio is resampled to 24 kHz internally and turned into 100-bin Vocos log-mel features
(cached next to the audio cache).

- `--quality base` (default fallback) uses the upstream model size; `--quality low` is a tiny
  smoke-test tier.
- Training uses the upstream recipe: ScaledAdam + the Eden schedule, 70–100% target-span
  infilling masks, and text-condition dropout for classifier-free guidance.
- `--resume-from-checkpoint` accepts both Lightning checkpoints and the upstream `{"model": …}`
  layout, so a released ZipVoice checkpoint can be a fine-tuning start point.

```bash
python -m phoonnx_train.train --dataset-dir train_out --engine zipvoice --quality base

python -m phoonnx_train.export_onnx last.ckpt \
  --config train_out/config.json --engine zipvoice --output-dir ./exported
# -> text_encoder.onnx + fm_decoder.onnx
```

See the [ZipVoice guide](engines/zipvoice.md).

## MOSS-TTS-Nano (standalone pipeline)

MOSS-TTS-Nano is an autoregressive codec LM, so it does not consume the phoneme-based
preprocessed dataset the `--engine` trainers share — it trains on pre-encoded RVQ tokens
and raw text, from its own CLI in `phoonnx_train/mosstts/`:

```bash
python -m phoonnx_train.mosstts.prepare_data --codec-encode-onnx ... \
  --input-manifest data/metadata.csv --output-jsonl data/train.codes.jsonl
python -m phoonnx_train.mosstts.train --train-jsonl data/train.codes.jsonl \
  --tokenizer-model tokenizer.model --warm-start-from models/MOSS-TTS-Nano \
  --output-dir runs/moss-pt
python -m phoonnx_train.mosstts.export_onnx --checkpoint runs/moss-pt/last.ckpt \
  --output-dir exported/moss-pt --external-data
```

See the [MOSS-TTS-Nano guide](engines/mosstts.md) for the data format, warm-start, resume
and export details.

## GlowTTS engine (`--engine glowtts`)

Trains GlowTTS, a flow-based text→mel acoustic model with Monotonic Alignment Search, vendored
in `phoonnx_train/glowtts/`. It consumes the same preprocessed dataset (mel features only — no
waveform/vocoder training).

- `--quality x-low|medium|high` scales encoder/flow widths; `medium` is the paper configuration.
- Recipe: MLE (flow NLL) + log-duration MSE losses, Adam with Noam warmup (4000 steps).
- Export produces the **mel model only**; synthesis pairs it with a separate vocoder ONNX (see
  [Vocoders](../vocoders.md)). The mel basis is pinned to fmin 0 / fmax 8000 Hz and recorded in
  the ONNX metadata.

```bash
python -m phoonnx_train.train --dataset-dir train_out --engine glowtts
python -m phoonnx_train.export_onnx last.ckpt --config train_out/config.json \
  --engine glowtts --output-dir ./exported
```

See the [GlowTTS guide](engines/glowtts.md).

## FastPitch / SpeedySpeech (`--engine fastpitch` / `--engine speedyspeech`)

The Coqui **ForwardTTS** family: a non-autoregressive text→mel model where an encoder produces
per-token states, a duration predictor expands them to frame rate, and a decoder renders an
80-channel mel. Durations are learned **unsupervised** (attention alignment + monotonic
alignment search — no external aligner). The model/loss code is vendored in
`phoonnx_train/fastpitch/` (pure-torch, no `TTS` dependency) and reuses the shared VITS
spectrogram cache, so switching between `vits` and `fastpitch`/`speedyspeech` on the same
phonemized dataset needs no re-preprocessing.

| | FastPitch | SpeedySpeech |
|---|---|---|
| encoder/decoder | FFT-transformer | residual conv-BN |
| pitch predictor | on | off |
| relative size | larger, higher quality | smaller, faster |

Both are the same engine class (`ForwardTTSTrainingEngine`); the `--engine` name only changes
the default `variant`, which can also be set via the engine's `extra` config
(`variant: speedyspeech`).

**Pitch (F0).** FastPitch's pitch predictor needs a frame-level F0 target. The engine's
`extra_preprocess` extracts F0 via `pyworld` (DIO + StoneMask) and caches it as
`<utterance>.f0.npy`, frame-aligned with the mel. Install `phoonnx[train,train-fastpitch]`.
Without `pyworld`/`librosa`, training still runs but the pitch predictor trains without its
target loss (a warning is logged). SpeedySpeech uses no pitch.

`--quality` (`x-low` / `medium` / `high`) scales `hidden_channels`, `hidden_channels_ffn`, and
the encoder/decoder layer count. FastPitch/SpeedySpeech are **two-stage** — a separate vocoder
is required at inference. See the [FastPitch guide](engines/fastpitch.md).

## StyleTTS2 engine (`--engine styletts2`)

A full two-stage engine porting the yl4579/StyleTTS2 recipe onto the shared framework. It
trains new models **from scratch in new languages** and fine-tunes existing checkpoints onto
new speakers. The upstream model/loss/data code is vendored in `phoonnx_train/styletts2/`.
Install `phoonnx[train,train-styletts2]`.

**Stages** (select with `stage` in `engine_params` / `StyleTTS2Config`):

| Stage | What trains |
|---|---|
| `first` | text aligner (TMA), text encoder, style encoder, decoder — mel reconstruction with ground-truth F0/energy; adversarial + WavLM feature-matching after `tma_epoch` |
| `second` | PL-BERT + duration/prosody predictors, style diffusion (after `diff_epoch`), joint decoder + SLM adversarial (after `joint_epoch`); starts from the stage-1 checkpoint (`first_stage_path`) |
| `finetune` | the `second` recipe with diffusion + joint enabled from epoch 0 — adapt a checkpoint to a new speaker/dataset |

**Auxiliary models** (all configurable via `engine_params`):

| Key | Model | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `asr_path` + `asr_config` | text aligner (ASRCNN) | upstream `Utils/ASR/`; trained further during TMA |
| `f0_path` | JDC pitch extractor | upstream `Utils/JDC/bst.t7` |
| `plbert_dir` | PL-BERT | upstream `Utils/PLBERT/` (English); pretrained es/ca ([PL-BERT-wp-es](https://huggingface.co/BSC-LT/PL-BERT-wp-es)), gl ([PL-ModernBERT-gl](https://huggingface.co/proxectonos/PL-ModernBERT-gl)); or train with `--engine styletts2-plbert` |
| `slm.model` | WavLM for SLM losses | HF hub, default `microsoft/wavlm-base-plus`; disable with `use_slm: false` |

Set `download_aux: true` to fetch the English aligner/pitch/PL-BERT automatically (cached under
`~/.cache/phoonnx/styletts2_aux_en`) for any unset path. Missing auxiliaries are otherwise
randomly initialized with a warning.

```json
{"engine_params": {"stage": "second", "first_stage_path": "…", "plbert_dir": "…", "download_aux": true}}
```

**Data layout.** StyleTTS2 uses the upstream list format inside the dataset dir:
`train_list.txt` / `val_list.txt` with `filename.wav|phonemes|speaker_id` lines and audio under
`wavs/` (24 kHz).

**Quality presets.** `low` (halved widths, iSTFTNet), `medium` (LJSpeech recipe, iSTFTNet),
`high` (LibriTTS recipe, HiFi-GAN decoder, multispeaker-ready).

**Export.** `export_onnx` (via `phoonnx_train/styletts2/export.py`) accepts an upstream `.pth`
or a Lightning `.ckpt` and emits the two-graph zero-shot contract the `StyleTTS2Adapter`
consumes — `model.onnx` (tokens + style + speed → waveform) and `style_encoder.onnx` (reference
waveform → style) — plus `config.json`. StyleTTS2 exports are self-contained; no external
vocoder is required.

### Training every StyleTTS2 step for a new language

A from-scratch model in a new language needs a language-specific text aligner and prosodic text
encoder trained first. `phoonnx_train` ships an engine for each:

| Engine | Trains | Consumed via |
|---|---|---|
| `styletts2-aligner` | ASRCNN text aligner (CTC + s2s CE) | `asr_path` + `asr_config` |
| `styletts2-plbert` | PL-BERT (`backbone: albert` or `modernbert`) | `plbert_dir` |
| `styletts2-pitch` | JDC pitch extractor (pyworld ground truth) | `f0_path` |

All three fine-tune too (warm-start via `pretrained_path` / `pretrained_dir`).

```bash
# 0. phonemize with phoonnx's own phonemizers
python -m phoonnx_train.styletts2.phonemize_corpus list \
    raw_list.txt dataset/train_list.txt --lang pt --phonemizer espeak
python -m phoonnx_train.styletts2.phonemize_corpus plbert \
    corpus.txt plbert_data --lang pt

# 1. text aligner   2. PL-BERT   3. pitch (optional)
python -m phoonnx_train.train --dataset-dir dataset   --engine styletts2-aligner
python -m phoonnx_train.train --dataset-dir plbert_data --engine styletts2-plbert
python -m phoonnx_train.train --dataset-dir dataset   --engine styletts2-pitch

# 4. StyleTTS2 stage first, then second (paths via engine_params in config.json)
python -m phoonnx_train.train --dataset-dir dataset --engine styletts2

# 5. export the two-graph ONNX contract
python -m phoonnx_train.export_onnx --engine styletts2 ...
```

## Evaluating checkpoints during training

`phoonnx_train/eval_loop.py` watches the training directory for new Lightning checkpoints
(`epoch=*.ckpt`) and scores each on a fixed set of held-out sentences, synthesized on CPU so
training keeps the GPU. Results are appended to `metrics.csv` (one row per epoch), per-utterance
scores are written for **every** epoch under `perutt/epoch<N>.csv` (columns `sentence`, `utmos`,
`spk_sim` — so a single sentence degrading while the mean holds is visible across epochs), and
the best epoch's wavs are kept under `samples/epoch<N>/`. The loop is idempotent — already-scored
(and permanently failed) epochs are skipped on restart. Needs `phoonnx[train-eval]`.

```bash
python -m phoonnx_train.eval_loop \
  --train-dir train_out --config train_out/config.json \
  --sentences heldout.txt --output-dir ./eval \
  --speaker-ref-dir my_dataset/wavs
```

Useful flags: `--once` (single pass), `--poll N` (seconds between scans, default 60),
`--dry-run`, and `--noise-scale` / `--length-scale` / `--noise-w` overrides.

Two metrics are reported: **UTMOS** (`utmos_*`, an automatic 1–5 MOS predictor — treat as a
relative ranker between checkpoints of the same voice, especially on non-English) and
**speaker similarity** (`spk_sim_*`, cosine similarity to a centroid of the target speaker's
reference recordings; needs `speakeronnx` + `--speaker-ref-dir`, otherwise only UTMOS is
scored).

## Evaluation and early stopping

The evaluation logic lives in the reusable `phoonnx_train.evaluation` package
(`CheckpointScorer`, `SelectionPolicy`, `MetricsTracker`, Lightning callbacks). The same code
runs in two modes.

### Sidecar mode (out-of-process scoreboard)

`phoonnx_train/eval_loop.py` is a thin CLI over the package — the flags above are unchanged.
Each checkpoint is loaded through the training-engine registry (`--engine`, default `auto`:
the `engine` key in `config.json` if present, else `vits`), synthesized on CPU with
**per-utterance deterministic seeding** (`torch.manual_seed(seed + i)` immediately before
utterance `i`, so the same checkpoint scored twice yields identical wavs and scores), and
scored. New flags:

- `--early-stop-patience N` — after `N` scored epochs pass with no new best, write a
  `stop.flag` into `--train-dir`.
- `--min-spk-sim FLOAT` — the similarity gate floor (see below).
- `--speaker-id INT` — speaker id for multi-speaker models (a warning is logged when
  `num_speakers > 1` and no id is given; synthesis falls back to the engine default voice).
- `--engine NAME` — engine override (default `auto`).
- `--vocoder PATH` — passed through to the engine's synthesis (engine-dependent; ignored by
  the end-to-end VITS engine).

### In-training mode (early stopping callback)

`train.py` gains opt-in flags: `--eval-sentences FILE`, `--eval-every N` (default `0` = off),
`--early-stop-patience N`, `--eval-speaker-ref-dir DIR`, `--min-spk-sim FLOAT`, `--eval-seed`.
When enabled, `EvalScoreboardCallback` runs the same `CheckpointScorer` in-process every `N`
epochs (after `ModelCheckpoint` saves), writes the same scoreboard under `<run-dir>/eval/`, and
sets `trainer.should_stop` once patience is exhausted. **Scoring failures never crash training**
— they are logged and swallowed.

`StopFileCallback` is **always** added to the trainer (even with evaluation off): it watches
`<run-dir>/stop.flag` and stops training when it appears. This is the sidecar → trainer bridge —
a sidecar `eval_loop` with `--early-stop-patience` can stop a training run it does not share a
process with. With no flag present it is a no-op.

### The similarity gate

`SelectionPolicy(metric="utmos_mean", min_spk_sim=...)` selects the best checkpoint by UTMOS
**gated on speaker similarity**: UTMOS alone can prefer a checkpoint whose voice has drifted
away from the target speaker (higher naturalness, wrong identity). When speaker scoring is
active and `--min-spk-sim` is set, a candidate must clear that floor to be eligible at all;
among eligible candidates the higher UTMOS wins. With no speaker score available (no reference
dir / `speakeronnx` missing) selection falls back to UTMOS-only and logs a warning.

### Artifacts and the stop.flag contract

- `metrics.csv` — one row per scored epoch (superset of the legacy header; old scoreboards are
  read and appended to compatibly).
- `best.json` — epoch, step, checkpoint path, and all scores of the current best.
- `best.ckpt` — a **copy** (not a symlink) of the best checkpoint, so it survives checkpoint
  pruning.
- `perutt/epoch<N>.csv` — per-utterance scores for every evaluated epoch (`sentence`, `utmos`,
  `spk_sim`), for tracking per-sentence trends / overfit across epochs.
- `samples/epoch<N>/` — the best epoch's synthesized wavs plus `perutt.csv`.
- `failed.json` — a checkpoint that fails to load/score 3 times is recorded failed and skipped
  forever (ERROR logged); no infinite retry.
- `stop.flag` — a single reason line. Its presence means "stop training"; the trainer's
  `StopFileCallback` reads the reason, logs it and stops at the next epoch boundary.

## Training a Vocos vocoder

Two-stage engines (Matcha and other mel-emitting engines) produce a mel and rely on a separate
vocoder. `phoonnx_train/train_vocos.py` trains a Vocos-style vocoder in-house so a voice can
ship with a vocoder trained (or fine-tuned) on the same speaker's audio.

**Data:** audio only, no transcripts — any directory tree of `.wav`/`.flac`/`.ogg`/`.mp3`
(including a preprocess `cache/` folder). A few hours of clean speech suffices for fine-tuning;
from scratch wants much more (or a `--warm-start`).

> **Mel settings are locked.** The vocoder is trained on the exact mel configuration phoonnx
> acoustic models use (`n_fft=1024`, `hop=256`, `win=1024`, 80 mels, `fmax=8000`, log-mel). A
> vocoder trained with different settings produces garbage for every phoonnx mel model.

```bash
python -m phoonnx_train.train_vocos \
  --audio-dir /path/to/voice/wavs \
  --sample-rate 22050 --batch-size 16 --crop-seconds 1.0 \
  --warm-start charactr/vocos-mel-24khz \
  --max-epochs 100 --default-root-dir /tmp/vocos_train
```

`--warm-start` accepts a local `.ckpt`/`.bin` or a HuggingFace repo id with reference-Vocos
weights; matching parameters are copied and the matched fraction logged.
`--resume-from-checkpoint` continues an interrupted run.

**Export and wire up:**

```bash
python -m phoonnx_train.export_vocos \
  /tmp/vocos_train/lightning_logs/version_0/checkpoints/epoch=99-step=12345.ckpt \
  vocoder.onnx
```

This writes `vocoder.onnx` (+ `vocoder.onnx.json` with the STFT parameters) in the layout the
vocoder registry auto-detects as `vocos`. Point any mel-emitting voice at it via
`engine_params={"vocoder_path": "vocoder.onnx"}`.

## config.json reference

Preprocess writes a `config.json` that both training and inference read. Key fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `dataset` | Dataset name (from `--dataset-name` or the parent dir) |
| `audio.sample_rate` | Training/inference sample rate |
| `audio.quality` | Arbitrary label (from `--audio-quality` or the output dir name) |
| `lang_code` | Language code used for phonemization (normalized with `langcodes`) |
| `inference.noise_scale` / `length_scale` / `noise_w` | Default inference scales |
| `inference.add_diacritics` | Apply diacritics at inference (Arabic/Hebrew only) |
| `alphabet` | Phoneme alphabet (`ipa`, `unicode`, `arpa`, `pinyin`, …) |
| `phoneme_type` | Phonemizer used (`espeak`, `gruut`, `byt5`, …) |
| `phonemizer_model` | Model/variant for phonemizers that take one |
| `phoneme_id_map` | Phoneme symbol → integer id |
| `num_symbols` | Size of the phoneme map |
| `num_speakers` | Number of speakers (1 for single-speaker) |
| `speaker_id_map` | Speaker label → id (multi-speaker) |
| `phoonnx_version` | Version of the preprocessing pipeline |

The full loaded form (tokenizer flags, special tokens, `engine_params`) is documented in the
[Configuration reference](../configuration.md).
